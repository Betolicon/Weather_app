# Weather App

I'm Alberto Alvarado

I'm a system engineer

I'm going to develop this weather app in the days ahead

I'm using webpack, all the theory I've been learning from 'The odin project' and something new
that's I'm going to be using an API for this project.

In the frontend, it's implemented something new that I've seen in the last days "Neumorphism"
And well, for the JS part, besides using the API, also I'm going to use other things in order 
to practice the theory I've been learning (like export and import files, handling erros, etc)
